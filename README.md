# Thermionics: World

This is a friendly fork of Falkreon's [Thermionics World](https://github.com/elytra/ThermionicsWorld), which was made under the elytra modding group.

This fork makes no major changes, but is kept online for those who might be interested in the changes detailed below:
 * Undoes the "Obsidian is Basalt" change
 
If you do not want these changes, I recommend you use Falkreon's version (linked above and again, below) instead.
Any critical bugfixes made on this version will be PR'd to the official version. 

**The only reason this exists is when I want to add this mod to a modpack, but find a specific feature does not fit.**
